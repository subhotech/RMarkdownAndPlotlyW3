data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")

# View content of data set diamonds
diamonds


## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))

# Plotting a bar graph
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut)

#Plotting Heat Map
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, y = ~clarity)

# Plotting bar graph with color legend 
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity, colors = "Accent")  %>%    layout(title = "Diamond Details")

```
